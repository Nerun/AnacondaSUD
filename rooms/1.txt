Recalcitrant Adventurer's Harbor
    The port's gray sand complements its decaying look very well. Many
adventurers land here daily, attracted by the stories of gold and glory. There
are also many fishermen and villagers from the local village doing their jobs
or trying to extract some coin from the newcomers.
    The Recalcitrant Adventurer's Harbor has been the gateway for all kinds of
adventurous spirits into the Realm of Shambles. Of course, this vast region
does not deserve to be called a "kingdom" but, without a doubt, it well
deserves the demeritable nickname of "shambles" as it is truly a lawless land.
In fact, it is officially called "vastness", and there are many here who
declare themselves kings and princes, or some other title.
    These powers rule in city-states or small regions over which they manage to
impose their authority. However, in the Realm of Shambles nothing lasts,
princes fall and rise day after day.
    The beach stretches from north to south, and to the east is the great sea
through which adventurers arrive. To the west there appears to be a customs
house.
