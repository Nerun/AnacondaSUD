# SUD Engine

SUD means for "Single User Dungeon": it's like a Multi User Dungeon (MUD) but for single player. In other words, it's a text-mode adventure with elements of both Role Playing Games and sandbox PC games. This is supposed to be just a game engine, not a playable game.

This game engine is being developed as from the scripts created by Tomas Varaneckas (Vilnius, Lithuania), and released on [his website](Http://paranoid-engineering.blogspot.com/2008/11/python-mud-game-example.html) on November 28th, 2008.
